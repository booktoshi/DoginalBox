# DoginalBox - Currently Updating Container. Check back for Updates in a couple of days.


## Overview

This setup provides a Docker container that installs and configures a Dogecoin node, along with several utilities, and resumes installation even after a system restart. The container will detect the operating system and install the Dogecoin node accordingly.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### What is Docker?

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

### What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose

#### For Windows and Mac:

1. Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Once installed, Docker and Docker Compose come bundled together.

#### For Linux:

1. Install Docker:

   ``sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install        apt-transport-https        ca-certificates        curl        gnupg        lsb-release

   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

   echo      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu      $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ``

2. Install Docker Compose:

   ``sh
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ``

3. Verify the installation:

   ``sh
   docker --version
   docker-compose --version
   ``

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the Docker setup files:

``sh
git clone https://github.com/booktoshi/DoginalBox
cd DoginalBox
``

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

``sh
./build.sh
``

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container

To start the Docker container, run the following command:

``sh
docker-compose up -d
``

### Step 5: Verify Dogecoin Node Status

To check the status of the Dogecoin node, run the following command:

``sh
docker exec -it dogecoin_node dogecoin-cli getblockchaininfo
``

## Resuming Installation

If the Docker container is stopped or the system is restarted, the installation can be resumed by starting the container again:

``sh
docker-compose up -d
``

The state management script will ensure that the Dogecoin node starts and the installation resumes as needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the logs for more details:

``sh
docker logs dogecoin_node
``

For further assistance, consult the documentation for Docker and Docker Compose.

This setup ensures a smooth installation and configuration of a Dogecoin node with additional utilities, while handling system restarts gracefully.
